# Captain Of Industry Data Export

This repo contains an export of the game data in JSON with the majority of relevant fields.

The current version of the mod only covers buildings/machines that are part of the production chain recipes. Thus, any buildings that are not part of production chaings (ramps, transports, retaining walls, etc) are not included.

The only exception is Vehicles and Ship upgrade parts which were specifically requested.

## Included Mod and Source Code

I have also included the Mod files and the source code, although in order to build from source you will need to setup the dev environment as only the main source code is included, no project or solution.

## Notes on Missing Data

This export does not contain everything. It does contains a majority of the constructable buildings and machines.
